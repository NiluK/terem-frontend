# Terem tech test

Simple checkout system built with Typescript.

## Prerequisites 

- Desktop screen over 1200px;
- OSX or a standard Linux distribution 
- Node.js 12+, I recommend installing Node via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

## Setup

`npm install`

## Run

`npm dev`

## Test

`npm test`

## Assumptions

As there was no styleguide and no responsive mobile design screens, I assume you didn't want pixel-perfect replication of the design and I assume that there was no intent on making this responsive as the current design does not fit responsiveness at all.
